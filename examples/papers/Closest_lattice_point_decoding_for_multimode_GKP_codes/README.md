In this folder, we provide the code to reproduce the results from the paper [Closest lattice point decoding for multimode Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04702). 

1. The data used in the paper can be found in the `data/` folder.

2. To reproduce the figures in the paper with existing data, simply rerun the corresponding notebooks. For example, running the notebook `Fig_2.ipynb` will produce Figure 2 in the paper.

3. The data can also be reproduced by the corresponding notebooks. For example, running the notebook `Get_fidelities_runtimes_repetition_codes.ipynb` will produce the fidelity and runtime for the repetition codes discussed in the paper.
